    <h3>Fantastic Reality</h3>
    <!-- <p>
      This painting was completing in an effort to work out newly gained knowledge of how the world works.  Along with the painting came the following poem:
    </p> -->
    <p>
      Wandering down a path consumed with the conviction of reality,
      proven only to be a manufactured fantacy.
      Accepted rather plainly the dream thought to be our own.
      Create the picture perfect home,
      Success measured by a white picket fence,
      Strive to become another idealistic social clone
      Left to wander the isles
      Blinded with deniles
      Containment through entertainment,
      Fantastic Reality
      A Fantacy

    <h3>Michelle</h3>
    <p>
      The first painting in my artistic journey.  A survivor. A secret. A fairy. A friend.

    <h3>Love Lotus</h3>
    <p>
      Painting for my youngest daughter in the eighth month of pregnancy.  It was used as a focal point during her birth. It has become an image used often in meditation.

    <h3>Protector and Muse</h3>
    <p>
      A product of an extraordinary art class I was fortunate to experience.  The instructor lead us on a guided meditation at the start of each class in search of our spirit creatures.  These are the two that visited me frequently.
