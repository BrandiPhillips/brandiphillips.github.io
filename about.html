    I applied to Ada Developers Academy because I wanted the oportunity to create the life I want for me and my two beautiful daughters.  And here I am doing all the scary things I need to learn, grow and be the best role model possible.  I am grateful for this opportunity and look forward to being involved in this community for years to come.  Please enjoy the pieces of me I have chosen to share with you here in my tiny spot of the webs.
